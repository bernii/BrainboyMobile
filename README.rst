============

This repository hosts the BrainBoy Mobile code.

BrainBoy Mobile is a fast proof of concept J2ME biofeedback application. It allows training low-level functions according to Warnke-method.

It is havely inspired by BrainBoy Universal that costst about 180EUR. As screen response times in mobile devices are nowdays very low, I thought that something similiar can be done and be made available to public with much less cost. This little app allows you to train visual order threshold (proccesing speed).

How to use:
============

* Just start the JAR and use arrow keys or numpad on your mobile to point which rectangle was visible earlier.
* If your answer is correct the next delay between stimuli will be the half of previous one.
